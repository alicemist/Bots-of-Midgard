Python XML Parser
This Python script allows you to read and parse XML files, extract their properties, and use this information to write a detailed Process Design Document (PDD).

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You will need Python installed on your machine. The script has been tested with Python 3.7+.

Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sefaozzer/xmlreader.git
cd xmlreader
Running the Script
You can run the script using Python. Pass the path to the XML file you wish to read as a command-line argument.

bash
Copy code
python main.py /path/to/your/xmlfile.xml
The script will read the XML file, parse it, extract its properties, and output the data to the console. You can use this data to write a detailed PDD.
